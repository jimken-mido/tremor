  "description": "Think about Tremor as an event- or stream-processing engine. It receives input data from various Connectors], turns the data into streams of structured events with the help of [Preprocessors and Codecs]. Those events are then handled by one or more [Pipelines, which can inspect, mutate and route the event and implement arbitrarily complex application logic. Events are either dropped (e.g. for rate-limiting or traffic-shaping) or sent to downstream systems via various Connectors]. Before actually leaving the system, those streams of structured events need to be serialized using [Codecs] and [Postprocessors.",
